# What are Mixins?

Mixin is a framework for modifying Java programs during runtime by injecting code into targeted methods and classes.

Mixin was built to work for Minecraft, but also supports any environment where you control the classloading.

Mixins are classes that allow you to perform these injections.

## Mixin Principals

Mixin is built off [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io), with the goal of having development be faster.
